- 👋 Hi, I’m @yaelmonnn and I'm a student of Management in Information Technology :)
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend and backend development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Html, Css and JavaScript. Soon I plan to learn more languages related to the frontend, such as: TypeScript, React, Vue, Jquery and Angular.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that allow me to integrate into the world of web development since I plan to found my own web development agency.
